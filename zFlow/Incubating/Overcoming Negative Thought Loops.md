title: Overcoming Negative Thought Loops
fileClass: incubating
lead: To overcome negative thought loops, start by recognizing when you're caught in one. Awareness is key to breaking the cycle. Once identified, challenge the thoughts by questioning their validity—are they based on facts or assumptions? Reframe the negative thoughts by replacing them with neutral or positive alternatives that focus on solutions instead of problems. To break the pattern, engage in activities like exercise or switching tasks, which can disrupt repetitive thinking. Mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing or grounding exercises, help keep you in the present. Finally, seeking external perspective—whether through talking to someone or writing down your thoughts—can provide clarity and objectivity.
