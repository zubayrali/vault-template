The first time I’d ever heard mention of this “rule/exception” theory was in the 2009 movie “[He’s Just Not That Into You](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1001508/)” starring Justin Long (among many other renown actors and actresses).

==Long’s character Alex== ==[explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyGOy1SQbXc)== ==that== _==it’s better to assume you’re the rule and not the exception.==_ ==In the movie, he’s speaking in terms of romantic relationships, though this mentality can be applied to most facets of life. Considering yourself the exception to the rule easily sets you up for failure.==

“So what,” you ask rather sarcastically, “I’m just supposed to settle for average, instead of strive for excellence?” Well, not exactly.

==By not identifying yourself as the exception, you cease to make excuses for someone’s bad behavior because you think the====rules== _==don’t apply==_ ==to you. And you won’t assume you’re so special that this person will make an exception and be different== _==because==_ ==of you.==

Let’s put this into context, shall we?

### Example 1:

You’re out late with a couple of friends from class one night, having drinks at a usual hot spot. One of your friends asks if he can invite his buddy to join, and you figure sure, why not?

You don’t find a lot of people attractive before getting to know them, but things are different this time. The new guy is tongue-bitingly handsome, and by some sheer twist of fate, he’s coming on to you. When I say coming on to you, I mean despite the tons of attractive people in this bar, he’s fallen under your spell. You’ve never had this effect on anyone before, never mind this particular specimen who reminds you of an older, well-dressed Johnny Depp circa 1990’s Cry Baby.

And he’s not just heavily flirting, he’s picking apart your mind and challenging you to a chess-game of intellectual prowess. You discover he’s in political science and wants to be a defense lawyer. You’re in criminology and are considering prosecution.

“Helping people means making sure no one gets wrongfully convicted,” he argues. “That’s the most important thing, protecting the freedom of the individual.”

You’re not taking the bait. “It’s more important to protect the innocent from criminal victimization,” you say, with conviction. “Wouldn’t it feel more ethical to support people you _know_ were unfairly treated?”

He’s enjoying this. “There’s something about you,” he says, making the kind of eye contact that makes you feel like he can see right through you. You wonder if this is all too good to be true. He smiles without taking his eyes off you.

#### The Breakdown:

* ==The== **==rule==** ==says== _==if it sounds too good to be true, it is.==_ ==He’s done this before and he’ll do it again. That’s why his words pour out like honey — he’s had lots of practice tending to bees.==
* ==The== **==exception==** ==says== _==this time will be different==_==, you truly are the most exquisite species of human he’s ever laid eyes on. He really did single you out from the crowd and get caught in your web. It’s meant to be.==
* ==The== **==truth==** ==says== _==it’s not an accident==_ ==that he makes you feel special, even chosen. That’s his particular brand of venom; he makes all the other girls feel special, too.== He’s actually got a live-in girlfriend who, in some misguided attempt at salvaging their relationship, he proposes to a few months later. They eventually break off their engagement, and he gets engaged and un-engaged at least a few more times in his twenties and thirties. He always makes sure to call you right when his relationship _du jour_ starts breaking down (every two or so years) and tries to convince you this time will be different. It never is.

### Example 2:

You learned how to write academically while in university, and by your fourth year, the writing process was indistinguishable from an elaborate math problem. Add topic sentence, subtract opinion, include sources, prioritize paraphrasing over direct quotes, be sure to transition one argument from the next, and end with an opener.

A few years later, you begin writing prose, free-flowing thoughts with very little structure or rigidity. And you start to develop a new voice. A different voice. _Your_ voice. You gain a little bit of recognition online and wonder if maybe writing could be a real thing for you.

You get a little ambitious and after much back and forth with yourself, decide to pitch your very first article to a literary magazine. It gets rejected. You’re instantly flooded with shame and feel embarrassed you ever considered yourself a writer. How _dare_ you? What credence do _you_ have that could lend any weight to your writing? How entitled do you think you are?

For a split second, you consider quitting altogether.

#### ==The Breakdown:==

* ==The== **==rule==** ==says== _==everyone’s a beginner in the beginning.==_ ==What we see are the successful fruits of others’ labor, what we don’t see are the hundreds of hours spent in the background leading up to this success. Besides, just because someone doesn’t like what you have to say, doesn’t mean it’s wrong.==
* ==The== **==exception==** ==says== _==skill is something that you either have or you don’t.==_ ==There is no try. If you’re good enough, you’ll be good enough right away. Talent is something you’re born with. If someone doesn’t like it, it’s because the writing is bad.==
* ==The== **==truth==** ==is== _==writing is a skill to harness==_==. The expert writer has received way more rejection letters than the beginner. There are always be people who will dislike your skill, but that doesn’t mean you don’t have something important to share with the world. And that doesn’t mean it always comes easily. You have to show up for your craft every day and put in the work. Your writing does get better the more you write, and continues to even now, a few years into it. It’s a damn good thing you took a chance on yourself.==

#### ==Here are other things that happen once you start holding yourself to the rule and not the exception:==

* ==You stop enabling bad behavior by coming up with every possible reason why something is not “as bad as it seems.”==
* ==You take people at their word and hold them accountable for their actions.==
* ==You don’t underestimate the value of hard work in getting what you want and don’t expect to spontaneously get lucky.==
* ==You don’t set yourself up for disappointment when you inevitably learn that once again, events can’t simply transpire because you== _==want==_ ==them to.==
* ==You stop feeling sorry for yourself and you stop wasting your valuable time waiting for something to change.==
* ==You set firm boundaries around your time and energy and only engage with situations and people of your choosing.==
* ==When something falls apart for you, you don’t take it personally; you recognize that life can be hard for all of us and it’s not anyone’s fault.==
* ==You take your time when engaging with someone new, and do the work to build a solid foundation in your relationship.==

==At the outset, telling you== _==not==_ ==to consider yourself an exception can be a harsh and swift blow to your ego. I get it. This concept isn’t meant to make you feel less special. It just means you should always assume the rules do and will apply to you.==

==The “rules” are there for a reason, regardless of the category itself. Rules are the ripe fruits of our labor, the hard-earned wisdom achieved by the masses. So when you hear someone tell you “that’s a red flag,” don’t default on the excuse “but a friend of a friend of mine met a guy who did that too, and they ended up together!”==

Just like you wouldn’t quit your salaried job to take a risky gamble on the lottery because someone in your hometown recently walked away with a jackpot. Or you wouldn’t blow your life savings on a website you thought up because Google ended up so successful.

==And hey, if a person or an opportunity comes along and makes you== _==their==_ ==exception, that’s a different story altogether; it means you’re playing by the rules== _==and==_ ==winning the game. Those, my friend, are odds worth betting on.==
