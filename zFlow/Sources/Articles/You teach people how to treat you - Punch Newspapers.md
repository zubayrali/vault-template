The first time I heard this expression, I thought it was odd and didn’t quite understand the strength and gravity of it until I started working as a counsellor/therapist.

It also made me think about my own life and situations I had tolerated and condoned for years. It is easy to criticise others for treating you badly and to absolve yourself of any responsibility for this poor treatment. This by default is teaching them how to treat you. In every area of life we teach people how to treat us and how we expect to be spoken to. We do this through our actions and our failure to act. For example, a friend is only a friend if they treat you in a reasonable manner which you would expect your friends to treat you.

What it means to teach people how to treat you

Start with yourself. …

1. Talk about your “rules of engagement.”
2. Communicate your needs clearly and compassionately. …
3. Model how you’d like to be treated. …
4. Reinforce behaviours you like. …
5. Pick a role model to emulate. …
6. Have realistic expectations.

We often hear the advice that it’s important to teach people how to treat us. But what does this really mean? What does it actually look like? Teaching people how to treat us is a process that involves teaching them “what is acceptable and unacceptable. It is about knowing what we need and want and being able to communicate it effectively to others.” This isn’t the same thing as always being right and someone disagreeing with us is not the same as being demeaned, diminished or devalued.

Everything we do in life has a payoff, which is why we invest in certain behaviours even when the result is not in our best interests. You go to work to make money. You go to parties because you enjoy it, or it helps you stay connected to your community. The same is true for human interactions. People don’t do things independently of the outcomes.

Let’s say, for example, that you have a co-worker who consistently takes credit for your ideas or goes out of their way to throw you under the bus. Or maybe someone is always rude to you or takes you for granted. These people behave that way because they’re getting some kind of payoff from you; which is, you let them get away with it. Otherwise, they would stop. They do not behave like that with others or only with those who allow them to get away with it.

I’m not saying that you’re responsible for another person’s behaviour. This is not about blame. But I am saying that you have power over your reactions. So, if there is a person in your life who isn’t treating you with the respect and consideration you deserve, you have a couple of decisions to make. Are you willing to accept accountability, and do you really want to make a change? If the answer is yes, then you should ask yourself:

“What am I doing to elicit this person’s behaviour or to allow it to continue?” Even if you think you aren’t doing anything, your inaction is speaking for you.

There have been many situations I have been in at work or with friends where decisions are usually made either to go somewhere or to engage in certain activities where other people seem to make the decisions.

Sometimes I didn’t like the decisions and I even felt resentful. I came to the conclusion that if I kept silent, resenting the person then that was my choice, in this case the payoff for me might have been that I didn’t want to put any effort into making a decision; for others, they may enjoy feeling wronged. But if you want to see a different result, then you need to teach the person how to treat you if you want a change. The only person you control is you!

It’s time to take ownership of the role you’ve been playing. Even if you have spent decades in the same old negative pattern, I guarantee that once you change the payoff, the behaviour will change as well.

Relationships are mutually defined, and the give-and-take never stops. Truth is we wouldn’t want it any other way.

Start with yourself.

To teach people how to treat you, you do not begin with them, you begin with yourself, and the way you treat yourself sets the standard for others on how you demand to be treated. People learn how to treat you based on what you accept from them. In other words, to create even a seemingly small amount of change will ripple out and create more change. Teaching others how to treat you starts with self-awareness, there are some questions we can ask ourselves to guide us. “How do I treat myself? What do I value? What do I want? What do I think I deserve?” Remember that you can’t change anyone else, but we can create a different reaction in others if we change ourselves.

Talk about your “rules of engagement.”

One of the biggest misconceptions people have about relationships is that others should know how they want to be treated. However, in order for people in a relationship to be on the same page, they need to have access to the same understanding.

Communicate your needs clearly and compassionately.

For instance, many couples criticise, yell, or give each other the silent treatment to communicate their needs. This is not only ineffective, but it also hurts your relationship. Rather than scream ‘you never listen to me,’ it is more helpful to express ‘I feel alone right now and I would be very grateful if I could have your undivided attention for 10 minutes’. Another example is: “I am feeling overwhelmed right now and would love it if I could get a few ideas from you.” In other words, we teach people how to treat us when we can identify a need and then express it in a clear and comprehensible way. If we use pouting, desperation, or even abuse, people do not learn how we want to be treated. All they hear is pouting, desperation and screaming. The message does not get across.

Model how you’d like to be treated.

It’s also important to be the person you want other people to be. That is, treat others the way you want them to treat you, this is the Golden Rule.

Reinforce behaviours you like

Reinforcement simply means expressing appreciation when the other person makes the effort to change their behaviour. Reinforce behaviours you like at the time it occurs and subsequently. It could be five minutes later, 10 minutes later, an hour later, a day later, 10 days later. You cannot reinforce a positive behaviour enough. As human beings, we respond to positive affirmations.

Pick a role model to emulate.

Find a role model of someone who demands respect and appears to have a strong sense of worth. This person might be a parent, peer, friend, teacher, coach, therapist, mentor or even a well-known celebrity. The important component of a role model is that they are emulating the desired beliefs and behaviours that you would like to adopt or integrate.

Have realistic expectations.

You don’t teach people how to treat you in a day, or a week, or a month; it probably takes many months at a minimum to really get someone to treat you the way that you want to be treated. This process takes a lot of practice and patience. And sometimes, people are too caught up in being rigid and defending their own reality to try to act differently.

When you start clarifying what you will and won’t tolerate the status quo, there’s also a risk that some people won’t stick around. So, you have to be prepared for that. At that point, you need to ask yourself what’s in your best interest, a relationship at the cost of your well being, or making room for the future relationships that you deserve.

Some common reasons why we don’t teach people how to treat us.

We want the approval of the person

We are afraid of retaliation

We are afraid they may too sensitive and take it the wrong way

We are personally invested in the situation

We don’t want to offend them

We are afraid of rejection

The truth is it doesn’t matter what the reasons are. You simply need to determine the level of respect you expect to be treated with and then hold people to that standard. To build better relationships, treat people how to treat you.
