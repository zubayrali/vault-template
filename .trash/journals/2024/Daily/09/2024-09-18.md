- 15:40 i feel like I'm going through another puberty in regards to how i feel about my body, #daily-record ^1726688409
	- you know what I fear while writing things about my body, anything to do with my body feels feminine and gay, i even fear transgenderism, but I know I'm not going to turn into a woman In fact all of this has been to improve my masculinity in a way or another so idk what the fear is but it sort of has a feminine energy to it.
- 15:43 I've used woman for motivation in fact I've done it quite a few times with and without realizating it. Even recently, wanting to show my obsidian to Ayushi kinda drove me but then she didn't seem THAT intrigued and my boner went away not physical but mental boner for wanting attention and approval. Maybe by repeatedly saying these things I'm pathologising my behavior? i fear that i might end up taking 'wrong' decisions because or my continued 'confusion' which is essentially a stubborn attachment of sorts. #daily-record ^1726688603
