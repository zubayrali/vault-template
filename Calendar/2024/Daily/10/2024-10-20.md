## Daily Log

- 10:37
  - Idea for personal experiment: Track my thoughts for a week and identify recurring negative patterns. How might this relate to the [[Self-Awareness]] concept in the book?
- 10:36
  - While reading [[Don't Believe Everything You Think]], I wonder how the concept of [[Cognitive Dissonance]] relates to the book's main thesis. Could reducing cognitive dissonance be a key to mental freedom?
- 10:01
  - Reading Plath's journals - her intense self-doubt reminds me of the concept in [[Don't Believe Everything You Think]] about not getting caught in negative thought loops. Wonder how her writing might have changed if she had access to these modern psychological insights?
