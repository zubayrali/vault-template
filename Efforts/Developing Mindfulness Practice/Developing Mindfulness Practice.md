## Objective

Develop and maintain a consistent mindfulness practice to improve mental well-being and cognitive processes.

## Key Components

1. Daily meditation sessions
2. Mindful breathing exercises
3. Thought journaling
4. Weekly reflection on progress

## Current Status

- Meditating for 10 minutes daily
- Journaling thoughts 3 times a week
- Exploring different mindfulness techniques

## Resources

- [[Don't Believe Everything You Think]]
- [[Meditation Practices]]
- [[Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction]]
- Headspace app for guided meditations

## Progress Tracking

- Week 1: Established daily 5-minute meditation routine
- Week 2: Increased to 10-minute sessions, started journaling
- Week 3: Noticed improved focus during work hours

## Reflections

### Week 1

Found it challenging to sit still for even 5 minutes. Mind constantly wandering. Need to be patient with the process.

### Week 2

Feeling more comfortable with the practice. Journaling is revealing some recurring negative thought patterns about work stress.

### Week 3

Beginning to notice moments of mindfulness during the day, especially when feeling stressed. The practice seems to be extending beyond the formal meditation sessions.
